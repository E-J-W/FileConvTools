<---END_OF_PARAMETERS--->

This is a configuration file for the tree2mca and tree2mca_gated codes.
If you change the format of the file, prepare for unforseen
consequences.

Parameter list:

INPUT_FILE - Path to a single ROOT file to take tree data from.  Incompatible with INPUT_FILE_LIST.
INPUT_FILE_LIST - Path to a list of ROOT files (plaintext, one file path per line) to take tree data from.  Incompatible with INPUT_FILE.

SORT_TREE_NAME - Name of the tree inside the specified ROOT file(s) to sort data from.
SORT_PATH - Path to the branch/leaf containing the data to be sorted.  Folder paths are designated with forward slashes eg. 'resDec/E' sorts data from the leaf with name 'E' in the branch 'resDec'.
GATE_TREE_NAME - (tree2mca_gated only) Name of the tree inside the specified ROOT file(s) containing gate data.
SORT_PATH - (tree2mca_gated only) Path to the branch/leaf containing gate data.  Folder paths are designated with forward slashes as in SORT_PATH.

SORT_DATA_SCALING_FACTOR - Multiplicative factor to scale sorted data by before writing the .mca file.  Applied before SORT_DATA_SHIFT.  Default: 1.
SORT_DATA_SHIFT - Number of bins to shift sorted data by before writing the .mca file.  Default: 0.
GATE_DATA_SCALING_FACTOR - (tree2mca_gated only) Multiplicative factor to scale gates by before writing the .mca file.  Applied before GATE_DATA_SHIFT.  Default: 1.
GATE_DATA_SHIFT - (tree2mca_gated only) Numerical value to shift gates by before writing the .mca file.  Default: 0.
Note that gate values smaller than 0 and larger than S32K (32768, unless redefined by the user in mca.h) will be discarded.

SORT_DATA_FWHM_RESPONSE
yes: Apply FWHM response parameters to broaden peaks in the resulting .mca file.
no: Don't apply FWHM response function.
FWHM_F, FWHM_G, FWHM_H - Parameters for the FWHM response function, defined as FWHM = sqrt(F*F + G*G*x + H*H*x*x), where x is the .mca channel number / 1000.

OUTPUT_FILE - Name of the output .mca file.
